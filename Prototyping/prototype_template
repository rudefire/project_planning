\section{Core Mechanics}
This section needs to cover the core mechanic or mechanics central to the concept.
This is not a comprehensive list of each thing the player will be doing while they
are playing but rather a succint explanation of the most important actions they 
will be taking. Some people refer to this as the 'hook'. The central mechanic is
important because each other mechanic will grow from it and tie back into it. Limit
core mechanics to a manageable number (three is a good cap, but one can be a great
place to start).
\\Examples:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{\textbf{Mario}: Jumping}
  \item{\textbf{Halo}: Shooting, Melee, Grenades}
  \item{\textbf{Rogue}: Turn based advancement, Permadeath}
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{Overall Goal}
This section needs to describe the goal the player is trying to achieve. This needs
to tie back into the previous section and detail how the core mechanic or mechanics
will help the player to achieve this goal. This is best described as the win state of
the game.
\\Examples:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{\textbf{Mario}: Rescue the princess}
  \item{\textbf{Halo}: Gain the most kills}
  \item{\textbf{Rogue}: Descend the dungeon, collect the Amulet of Yendor and return 
    to the 1st level}
\end{itemize}

\section{Central Challenge}
This section needs to detail the central challenge standing in the way of the player
reaching their goal. This can take many different forms and ties into the overall goal
as well as the core mechanics. In a narrative context, this is best understood as the
central conflict. All other obstacles will stem from this central challenge. So, what 
stands in the way of your player achieving their goal?
\\Examples:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{\textbf{Mario}: Bowser and his minions}
  \item{\textbf{Halo}: Other players}
  \item{\textbf{Rogue}: The random generation and enemy placement}
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{Concept Specific Terms}
This section needs to cover anything within the game world that needs a specific description
of what it is and what function it serves within the game world. This list should include
any items, enemies, concepts, or mechanics that are not readily described by their names
outside of the game itself. This gives a starting point to share the game world with
others.
\\Examples:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{Mario}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{Mario}: Mario is the main character. He is an Italian plumber
      who is very good at jumping.}
    \item{\textbf{Mushroom}: mushrooms will make Mario grow and allow him to take
      extra damage.}
    \item{\textbf{Coin}: coins will be littered throughout levels and hidden within
      blocks for the player to collect and increase their score}
    \item{\textbf{Block}: blocks are destructible by Mario jumping into them. They can
      hold Mushrooms and Coins.}
  \end{itemize}
  \item{Halo}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{Spartan II}: Spartan IIs are the super soldiers that players take the
      role of}
    \item{\textbf{Pistol}: a pistol capable of dropping a Spartan II in three well aimed shots.}
    \item{\textbf{Shields}: a regenerating energy shield that the take damage for the player.
        Once the shields have taken enough damage, they will go down and the player's health
      will be open to damage.}
  \end{itemize}
  \item{Rogue}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{Dungeon floor}: A procedurally generated level that the player must explore
      in order ot find items, fight monsters, and find}
    \item{\textbf{Scroll}: an item that allows the player to cast a one off spell.}
    \item{\textbf{Spell}: a skill that the player can learn to give them a new magic based
      ability. Can be a fireball, a teleport, a freeze.}
